Day - 1
1. Write a program to accept a number and determine whether it is a prime number or
not.
2. Write a program to accept a number “n” from the user; then display the sum of
the series 1+1/2+1/3+……….+1/n.

3. Write a program to accept 2 different numbers from the user and print all the
prime numbers between these 2 numbers.

4. Write a program to accept a number “n” from the user; then display the sum of
the series 1/23+1/33+1/43……..+1/n
3
.
5. Write a program to print the Fibonacci series up to the number 34.
(Example: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,… The Fibonacci Series always starts with 0 and 1,
the numbers that follow are arrived at by adding the 2 previous numbers.)

6. Write a program to accept a number from the user; then display the reverse of
the entered number.
(Example: Entered number = 12345; Reversed number = 54321)

7. Write a program to accept a number from the user and determine the sum of digits of
that number. Repeat the operation until the sum gets to be a single digit number.

8. Write a program to accept 2 numbers “m” and “n” from the user, and determine
the value of mn
 without using predefined functions.
 
9. Write a program to accept a five digit number, increment each digit by 1 and then
display the new number formed. Note that digit 9 gets incremented to 0.
Example:
Input: 14389
Output: 25490

10. Write a program to print the following output
pattern. 1
        121
       12321
      1234321
     123454321
